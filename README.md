# Description - Random Password Generator

This is an application utilizing Javascript to randomly generate a password based on user selections for length and character type.  


Included in this application are:
* HTML code utilizing semantic elements to optimize for accessibility
    * Utilized `<header>`, `<footer>` and `<nav>` elements to easily distinguish from the rest of the body 
    * Utilized `<section>`, `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` to more easily identify main items as well as images
    * Implimented `alt` attribute for images to improve accessibility as well 
* Utilized efficient CSS code
    * Consolidated classes where possible to reduce clutter in code
    * Implimented `--var` options to reduce the need to retype or copy/paste redundant colors for fonts

Challenges I encountered
* Due to the limited time to cover subjects in classes, I researched how to impliment flexboxes in order to further familiarize myself with manipulate the box model to be able to design the page the way I intended it to look
    * Sizing of the individual flex items became an issue, in part due to cluttered code. As I familiarized myself and became more comfortable with flexbox attributes, I was able to reduce the clutter 
    * Chrome Developer Tools were a very helpful resource, allowing me to play with different attributes and immediately see what impact my changes were having before adjusting my code
* While we were provided the example application's code, I tried not to rely on it, as I wanted the portfolio to be my own work. 
* When necessary, I utilized office hours, reached out to classmates, and sought the advice and expertise of my tutor
